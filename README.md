<h1>Hi, I'm Bryce! <br/><a href="https://github.com/bryce-graffin">Programmer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryce-graffin/">United States Air Force Data Scientist</a></h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
  With 6 years of programming experience across Python, Java, HTML, C++, and C#, I have honed my skills in diverse environments, including Linux, Windows, and Mac systems. Currently serving as a Data Scientist for the United States Air Force, I focus on leveraging big data and machine learning to develop cutting-edge applications that shape manpower policy across the Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve components.

  My work has earned recognition, including the honor of being named Company Grade Officer of the Quarter by the Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency. I am deeply committed to using my military experience to lead and mentor the next generation of data scientists, driving excellence both in the field and the workforce at large.

  Collaboration is at the heart of my approach ‚Äî I thrive in team settings, where complex challenges are tackled together. Yet, I also appreciate the focus and growth that come from individual projects, especially in environments that foster innovation.
